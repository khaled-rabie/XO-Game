# XO-Game
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ console app



A simple console-based XO game implemented in C++.

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of the classic XO  game where two players, X and O, take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Console-based interface
- Validates player input
- Detects and declares the winner or draw

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a C++ environment.
2. Players take turns to enter the row and column numbers to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
3. The game ends when a player forms a line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all spaces are filled resulting in a draw.

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
